# Welcome to ITO Flutter education repository

In ITO we trully believe in the power of open source, sharing knowlednge and creating development standards. Keeping up with that logic we created this repository as the central place of our knowledgebase and most recent standards for flutter projects. We are trying our best, but we can't cover it all or in the best way possible, so we encourage you to feel free to contribute to this repository and build the more standardized flutter community.
